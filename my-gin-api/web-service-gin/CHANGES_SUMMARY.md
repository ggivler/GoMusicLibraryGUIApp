# Changes Summary: Fixed read_write_json Function in main.go

**Date:** 2025-08-23  
**File:** `main.go`  
**Issue:** The `read_write_json` function was not working - it was only a placeholder that returned an empty slice.

## Problems Identified

### 1. Non-functional read_write_json Function
- **Before:** Function was just a placeholder with a print statement
- **Issue:** Always returned an empty `[]FileInfo{}` slice
- **Result:** No data was being loaded from `data.json`

### 2. Incorrect Logging Format
- **Before:** `fmt.Println("found %d", len(musicFiles))`
- **Issue:** Literally printed "found %d" instead of the actual count
- **Result:** Misleading console output

### 3. Missing JSON Structure Handling
- **Issue:** `data.json` has a top-level object with a "files" array, but the code didn't account for this structure
- **Result:** JSON parsing would fail if attempted

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Required Imports
```go
import (
    "encoding/json"  // Added for JSON parsing
    "fmt"
    "net/http"
    "os"            // Added for file operations

    "github.com/gin-gonic/gin"
)
```

### 2. Created JSON Structure Handler
```go
// wrapper for the top-level JSON object in data.json
type fileList struct {
    Files []FileInfo `json:"files"`
}
```

### 3. Implemented Complete read_write_json Function
```go
func read_write_json(inputFile, outputFile string) []FileInfo {
    // Read the input JSON file which has a top-level object with a "files" array
    data, err := os.ReadFile(inputFile)
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Printf("error reading %s: %v\n", inputFile, err)
        return nil
    }

    var fl fileList
    if err := json.Unmarshal(data, &fl); err != nil {
        fmt.Printf("error parsing %s: %v\n", inputFile, err)
        return nil
    }

    // Optionally write a pretty-printed flat array to outputFile for debugging/consumption
    out, err := json.MarshalIndent(fl.Files, "", "  ")
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Printf("error marshaling output: %v\n", err)
        return fl.Files
    }
    if err := os.WriteFile(outputFile, out, 0644); err != nil {
        fmt.Printf("error writing %s: %v\n", outputFile, err)
    }

    return fl.Files
}
```

### 4. Fixed Logging Statement
```go
// Before:
fmt.Println("found %d", len(musicFiles))

// After:
fmt.Printf("found %d\n", len(musicFiles))
```

## New Functionality

### JSON Reading
- Reads `data.json` file using `os.ReadFile()`
- Properly handles the JSON structure with top-level "files" array
- Includes comprehensive error handling for file and JSON operations

### JSON Writing
- Writes a pretty-printed JSON array to the output file
- Uses proper indentation for readability
- Handles write errors gracefully

### Error Handling
- File reading errors
- JSON parsing errors
- JSON marshaling errors
- File writing errors

## Results After Fix

- ✅ Successfully loads **473 music files** from `data.json`
- ✅ Proper console output: "found 473"
- ✅ Web server starts correctly on `localhost:8080`
- ✅ `/musicfileinfo` endpoint returns loaded data
- ✅ Creates formatted `output.json` with the parsed data

## Data Structure

The function now properly handles the JSON structure where:
```json
{
  "files": [
    {
      "alphabetizing letter": "C",
      "full path to folder": "C:\\Users\\...",
      "original filename": "Christmas 2011.pdf",
      "song title": "2011",
      "voicing": "UNKNOWN",
      "composer or arranger": "UNKNOWN",
      "file type": "PDF",
      "file create date": "2011-08-15",
      "library type": "Christmas,"
    },
    // ... 472 more files
  ]
}
```

## Testing Verification

The fix was verified by:
1. Running `go run main.go`
2. Confirming 473 files were loaded
3. Observing the web server start successfully
4. Seeing successful HTTP GET requests in the logs

The function now provides a robust foundation for the Go Music Library GUI application.
